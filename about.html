                <p>My name is Alex Humphries! I am a Junior Web Developer and Computer Science student just starting out, this website is my first of hopefully many. I have learned a lot during my 2020 Spring Quarter, and especially in my CIS 215 class of Web Development, so I am showing a bit of it here on this site. I like cats (I will include a picture of my cat, Bigfoot), video gaming, hanging out with friends, coding, television, and many other things. I am attending the University of Washington Tacoma in the Fall in a pursuit of a Computer Science degree, and I hope to be able to do something some day that peaks my interest.</p>

                <div class="item3">I have worked for a number of companies since as young as 15. I worked at a company that moved bouncy houses for children, at McDonald's, at Sonic Drive-in, and most recently, Fred Meyer's, which I currently work at. None of these really have anything to do with Web Development, but they show that I am a hard and earnest worker.</div>
                <div class="item4">I have just recently received both my diploma and an associate of arts degree from Pierce College. The work was tough, and I really had to work hard to achieve my goals, but in the end I accomplished what I set out to do. I still have a long way to go, however, as I am still planning to get my computer science degree from the University of Washington Tacoma in the future.</div>
                </div>
                <p class="dark">Now that you have gotten to know me and my cat a little bit, I hope you understand me a little bit more, and I hope my story inspires you to pursue your own dreams and goals.</p>
